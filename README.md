## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query - Responsiveness
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery - js

### What I learned

I got better understanding about organising and planning while writing Html before applying the CSS.
Got more experience using Media Query for mobile phones responsiveness.
The functionalities and calculations using Javascript made easier with the help of jQuery library.

### Continued development

The future developments that can be introduced into this project are.

- Option to redirect into payment gateways
- Using a complete record of payments along with shared partners details in databases (Only if the user selected the payment option using this application)


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/) - This helped me as a reference for using the jQuery library for javaScript
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Stackoverflow helped me in clearing doubts and debugging the codes and also to correct errors. Some reference codes from Stackoverflow was of greater help in styling purpose too.
